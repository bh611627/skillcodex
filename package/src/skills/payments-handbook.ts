# Instructions

Plan **payments** integration with **strict PCI boundaries** and **Next.js**.

1. **Never** store **PAN**, CVV, or mag stripe data. Use **PSP-hosted fields** (card Element / Payment Element pattern) so card data touches PSP JS only.
2. **Server:** create **PaymentIntent** / session server-side with **idempotency key**; return client secret to UI; verify amounts and currency server-side on success.
3. **Webhooks:** implement with **\`webhook-receivers\`** - verify signature, **idempotent** event processing, handle \`amount_captured\` vs \`metadata\` order.
4. **PCI scope:** prefer **SAQ A**-style architecture (redirect or iframe/Element hosted by PSP); documenting “we never touch raw card” is required in reviews.
5. **Refunds / disputes:** outline state machine (pending → succeeded → refunded); no destructive scripts without approval.
6. **Testing:** PSP test cards only; no live keys in repo; \`.env.example\` keys named only.
7. **Fulfillment:** pair with **\`api-handbook\`** for idempotent order creation from webhook handlers.

## Outcomes

- Architecture diagram (bullet): browser → PSP → your API → DB + webhooks.
- Checklist: idempotency, verification, logging red lines.

## Output Rules

read-only design unless user explicitly requests code and approves. No real API keys.

## Scope and boundaries

- **In scope:** integration patterns, PCI boundaries, webhook pairing.
- **Out of scope:** tax/VAT legal advice, crypto on-ramp compliance, custom acquirer protocols.

## Safety

- **high** + **requires_user_approval:** true - money and compliance.
- Do not suggest storing cardholder name + PAN together in your DB.

## Troubleshooting

- **Webhook amount mismatch:** always fetch authoritative intent from PSP API before fulfilling order.
- **Client secret leaked:** rotate keys; never log client_secret.
