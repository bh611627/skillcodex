# Instructions

Add **observability** that works with **Next.js App Router**: logs, errors, and light tracing.

1. **Correlation:** generate or forward **\`x-request-id\`** (or trace id) in Route Handlers and middleware; pass through Server Actions via async context or explicit argument - pick one pattern per app.
2. **Structured logs:** JSON lines in server runtime; fields: \`level\`, \`msg\`, \`time\`, \`route\`, \`requestId\` - **no** raw emails, tokens, or full query strings with secrets.
3. **Client errors:** \`error.tsx\` / reporting hook sends **sanitized** message + stack fingerprint only; pair with **\`error-loading-not-found\`**.
4. **PII:** log user ids (opaque), not names/emails, unless audited retention policy says otherwise.
5. **External APM (optional):** if repo has Sentry/Datadog/etc., initialize **server-only** SDK in instrumentation file pattern; never ship server DSN in client bundles.
6. **Performance signals:** log slow query thresholds as metrics names, not raw SQL with literals.

## Outcomes

- Logging contract markdown + file list (\`instrumentation.ts\`, logger util) matching repo.

## Output Rules

Redact examples; use \`req_***\` style ids.

## Scope and boundaries

- **In scope:** app-side logging and error capture wiring.
- **Out of scope:** Kubernetes operator setup, log warehouse schema design.

## Safety

- repo-files only when user asks for edits; never paste production DSNs.

## Troubleshooting

- **Double logging:** middleware + layout both log same request - dedupe with id guard.
- **Edge vs Node:** OpenTelemetry exporters often Node-only - split instrumentation.
