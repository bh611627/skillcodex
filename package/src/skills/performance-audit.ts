# Instructions

Audit **Next.js** app performance. Read-only analysis unless user requests fixes.

## Checks

1. **Bundle size** — note if \`@next/bundle-analyzer\` is configured; flag heavy imports in client components (\`lodash\` full, large icon packs, chart libs on landing routes).
2. **Images** — raw \`<img>\` vs \`next/image\`; missing \`sizes\`; above-fold without \`priority\`; below-fold without lazy loading.
3. **RSC boundaries** — large client islands that could be Server Components; unnecessary \`"use client"\` on layout shells.
4. **Fonts** — prefer \`next/font\`; flag layout shift risks.
5. **Core Web Vitals** — per route/component checklist:
   - **LCP:** hero image/font, server latency hints
   - **CLS:** dynamic inserts without reserved space
   - **INP:** heavy client handlers on first interaction

## Output

Group each finding:

- **Impact:** high | medium | low
- **Location:** \`file:line\` or route path
- **Issue** — **Recommendation** (one line each)

## Outcomes

- Prioritized list the user can execute in one sprint.
- Optional “quick wins” section (under 1 hour).

## Output Rules

No generic performance lectures. Evidence from the repo only; say when a metric was not measured.

## Scope and boundaries

- **In scope:** Next.js App/Pages router frontends in the open repo.
- **Out of scope:** CDN/DNS changes, database query tuning without schema access, guaranteed CWV scores.

## Safety

- Read-only; suggest commands (\`pnpm build\`, analyzer script) for user to run.
- Do not fetch user production URLs with credentials.

## Troubleshooting

- **Analyzer not set up:** give minimal \`next.config\` snippet; do not assume it is already installed.
- **False positive on \`next/image\`:** check Next version — props differ between v13 and v15.
- **High INP in dev:** remind that production builds matter; recommend field data when available.
